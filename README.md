RISC-V Ibex Core with Built-In Self-Test (BIST) Integration📌 Executive SummaryThis project demonstrates the integration of a custom Built-In Self-Test (BIST) architecture into the execution stage of the open-source RISC-V Ibex Processor. The design encapsulates the core Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Multiplier/Divider (MultDiv) within a proprietary BIST wrapper, enabling self-verification capabilities while maintaining compatibility with standard RISC-V instructions.A critical challenge regarding bit-width mismatches (34-bit internal vs. 32-bit interface) was resolved through RTL engineering, and the final design was successfully synthesized and verified using Xilinx Vivado.🏗️ System ArchitectureThe project replaces the standard Ibex execution block with a wrapped version that includes test logic.Top Module: ibex_alu_bist_wrapperCore Modules:ibex_alu: Standard Arithmetic Logic Unit.ibex_multdiv_fast: Fast Multiplier/Divider unit (Modified).Functionality: The wrapper intercepts operands, manages the BIST state machine (optional expansion), and drives the execution units.🔧 Technical Challenges & RTL ModificationsDuring the integration, a significant compatibility issue was identified between the Ibex MultDiv unit and the custom 32-bit BIST architecture.🔴 The Problem: Bit-Width MismatchThe ibex_multdiv_fast module internally utilized a 34-bit signed data path ([33:0]) for intermediate calculations, whereas the target BIST wrapper was designed for a standard 32-bit RISC-V interface ([31:0]). This caused synthesis failures and connectivity issues.🟢 The Solution: Surgical RTL TruncationTo resolve this, the internal datapath of the MultDiv unit was modified:Signal Truncation: The intermediate value signal imd_val_q_i was truncated from 34-bits to 32-bits ([31:0]).Logic Adaptation: Bit-slicing operations in the SystemVerilog source code were updated (e.g., [33:16] $\rightarrow$ [31:16]).MSB Handling: Logic blocks attempting to access the removed upper bits ([33:32]) were hardwired to 2'b00 to prevent synthesis errors while preserving arithmetic correctness for unsigned operations.📊 Verification & Simulation ResultsThe integrated design was verified using a behavioral testbench (tb_ibex_ex_block.sv) in Vivado. The simulation confirms that the BIST wrapper correctly drives the processor core and retrieves accurate results despite the bit-width modifications.
